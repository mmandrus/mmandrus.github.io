Michael is a staff software engineer working for Grafana labs since 2012. He likes technology, but loves being part of a team of developers solving knotty challenges together. Personal relationships and seeing people succeed is what makes the job worth doing.

He also likes to write, but historically hasn't done much of it. He's hoping to change that through this site!

Outside of work, Michael enjoys quiet time in Central Massachusetts with his wife, four cats, and dog. He dabbles in art, cooking, and whatever else temporarily catches his attention.
