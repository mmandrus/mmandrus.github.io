***Description**: When my mentor and friend Stephanie Hingtgen asked me to submit a proposal to Kubecon with her, I nervously said "yes". I'm glad I did, because we had a lot of fun with it! I was learning about Grafana Cloud's deployment strategy in the midst of writing a talk about it, which really pushed me to dive deep.*

**Abstract**

Like many developers, the Grafana as a Service team used to dream of deploying to the cloud more often to get features and bug fixes to users faster. However, maintaining release stability amidst major code changes, such as new features or refactors, proved challenging. 

Join Senior Software Engineer II Stephanie Hingtgen and Senior Software Engineer Michael Mandrus as they walk through their two year journey of transforming our deployment processes to increase release frequency, without compromising stability, while over 100 engineers actively contributed to the codebase. Learn how they facilitated safer rollouts, helped foster a cloud-first mindset, established robust monitoring for seamless and cost-effective feature rollouts, and learned from their mistakes along the way. 

If you have ever been in the trenches of large-scale application development, this is an opportunity to hear about our experiences delivering software to a large Grafana Cloud user base, learn about best practices for rolling out features safely to your users, and gain the confidence to implement stable daily deployments yourself.
